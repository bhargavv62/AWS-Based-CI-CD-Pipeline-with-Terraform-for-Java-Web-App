## INTRODUCTION

In today’s fast-paced software development world, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are essential for building and delivering reliable, high-quality applications efficiently. This post walks through how to set up a real-time CI/CD pipeline for a Java application using Jenkins, enabling seamless and automated deployment on an Apache server.

A CI/CD pipeline streamlines the entire process of building, testing, and deploying code, helping teams deliver updates quickly and consistently. It improves collaboration, minimizes manual intervention, and ensures that every code change passes through a standardized, automated workflow before moving to production.

For Java applications, this setup involves configuring Jenkins to manage build automation with Maven, execute test suites, and deploy generated artifacts directly to an Apache environment. This approach not only reduces manual effort but also ensures reliable and repeatable deployments.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to integrate version control, automate testing, generate artifacts, and configure Jenkins for continuous deployment. By the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of how to build a robust CI/CD pipeline that streamlines Java application delivery from code commit to production release.

Let’s begin by setting up a real-time CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to deploy a Java application on an Apache server.
